# The Change Operator


## For Words

The change operator for a word is invoked by typing `ce` while your cursor is above some text. Then you write the corrected text and press `<ESC>` to exit back to normal mode.

## For Lines

The same behavior can be achieved on an entire line by using `cc`. It basically deletes the line and puts you in the Inser mode.

## Other Changes

It's possible to use change on the same way we use the [[7 - Operating Deletion on Lines|Operating Deletion on Lines]]. It means we can use [[6 - List of Motions|Motions]] and numbers.
