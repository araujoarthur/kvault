# Cursor Location and File Status

## How to see the current location in the file(%) and the file Status

The command used to see both the location (in percentual) within the file and the file status is `CTRL + G`.

## How to go to the top of the File

The command used to go straight to the top (beginning) of the file is `gg`, while the command `G` (uppercase, yes) is used to go to the bottom of the file.
