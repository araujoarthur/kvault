# The Append Command

## Right After (`a`)

While the insertion command `i` just starts the insert mode at the current location, the append command `a` puts the cursor **right after** the cursor's current position.

## At the end of the line `A`

The uppercase *A* command, `A`, appends to the end of the line by sending the cursor to the end of the line and starting the *Insert* mode.
