# The Open Command

## Opening Below the Cursor

The command to open a line **below** the cursor is `o` (lowercase *o*).

This command is used to **open a new line below the cursor's line**, **send the cursor to the new opened line** and **put the user in insert mode** in exactly this order.

1. Opens a new line below the cursor's current line.
2. Sends the cursor to the beginning of the opened line.
3. Switches to **Insert** mode.

## Opening Above the Cursor

The cursor to open a new line **ABOVE** the cursor's current line is simply the `O` (uppercase *O*).

This command does the same as `o`, except for the positions:

1. Opens a new line **above** the cursor's current line.
2. Sends the cursor to the beginning of the newly opened line.
3. Switches to **Insert** mode.
