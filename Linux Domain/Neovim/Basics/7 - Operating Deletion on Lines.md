# Operating Deletion on Lines

In normal mode, typing simply `dd` will delete the whole line **and store it in a vim registry**.

This command can also be used with a number as described in [[5 - Change Command Format, Motions and Counts|here]], for example:

```
2dd
```

Deletes the current line and the next.
